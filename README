SBChroot is a tool that simplifies and automates the creates of 
`full install' changeroots for Slackware. The script assumes the 
presence of a mirror on the local system from which it can install.

If you like to submit a patch, bugfix etc. The preferred method is
to clone my code on github and ammend the code and submit a pull
request. Failing that .. please email patches in a full unified diff
format (diff -Naur) only.
