configuration: Added support for either Slackware or Slackware64.
  Thanks to Andrew Brouwers (aka thrice`) for the patch.
chroot_create: Added an check, to see if the directory before 
  proceeding withthe installation.
chroot_patch: Check if we actually have .new files to warn about. If 
  we don't have anything. Don't mention anything needing to be moved over
general: Check first if we need just the help (we don't need to be root
  for this). Finally display the help if we encounter an option that 
  doesn't exist. Thanks to Andrew Brouwers for the suggestion.
chroot_warn: Added function to check if any non standard packages are
  either on or left on the chroot. Disabled for now until I can check
  this code properly
configuration: Added support for multiple jobs by setting MAKEFLAGS
configuration: Added support for custom/system language. Currently set 
  to the default of en_US.UTF8.

choot_config: Changed a quick error in the chroot_config function.
  Sourcing of /etc/profile should be directed to /dev/null instead of
  pointing to itself. Mea Culpa. :-)
configuration: Added code so we in the possible future we can read
  our configuration out of either a global or local configuration file.
general: all function prefixed with "function" (Just to be OCPD about
  these kinda things.
